        About our services
    </h1>

<h2>
    BMW PAY MONTHLY SERVICE PLAN.
</h2>

<h4>
    We know how precious your BMW is, and how important regular services are.
     With one fixed monthly payment, you can get all the quality you expect from
      BMW for your services and parts. This means you can keep your service history 
      up to date at a manageable, locked-in price. You can rest easy knowing that we’ll
       put the same love and attention into servicing your BMW as we did making it.
</h4>
<h2>
    BMW VALUE SERVICE.
</h2>

<h4>
    BMW Value Service is a menu of service pricing designed specifically for
     each BMW Model over three years old. You can select exactly which parts of 
     your vehicle you want serviced or simply have the whole car inspected.
      At the end of any work, your vehicle’s new parts will have a two-year fitted
       warranty, only available with BMW Genuine Parts. We will also update your 
       BMW service history so you know exactly when your BMW needs its next service.
</h4>

<h2>
    FAST LANE SERVICE.
</h2>

<h4>
    A BMW Fast Lane Service only takes 90 minutes or less, meaning you’re not 
    off the road for any longer than you need to be. Enjoy the wait and catch 
    up on news or entertainment via the complimentary WiFi, or take it easy and 
    enjoy a free coffee. If you’re looking for your next BMW, you could even 
    take the opportunity to enjoy a test drive while you wait.
</h4>

<h2>
    AIR CONDITIONING SERVICE.
</h2>

<h4>
    The air conditioning in your BMW does more work than you might 
    think – keeping the interior cool or warm throughout the year 
    is just one part. Your vehicle also filters pollen, dust from
    the road and harmful fumes. A BMW Recharge or Refresh,
     carried out by one of our expert technicians, is the best
      way to maintain the health of your car and ensure the air 
      conditioning system is functioning how it should be.
</h4>

<h2>
    SERVICE WHILE YOU FLY.
</h2>

<h4>
    Whether you fly regularly or only from time to time, 
    having your BMW serviced while you are in the air 
    makes total sense. Our BMW approved Service While You 
    Fly centre will ensure that all work is carried out to
     the highest of standards, whether that is routine 
     servicing and maintenance or even repair work; and 
     what’s more, as well as potentially saving you money 
     on airport parking fees, we will ensure that your BMW 
     is waiting for you as soon as you leave the terminal, w
     hatever time of day or night.
</h4>

<h2>
    EASIER SERVICING WITH THE My BMW APP.
</h2>

<h4>
    Download the new My BMW App and enjoy a smarter and more streamlined
    approach to servicing your BMW. With the app you can now be informed
     when you need a service, and it can even help you book an appointment.
      It’s never been so simple.
</h4>

<h2>
    BMW ELECTRONIC VISUAL HEALTH CHECK.
</h2>

<h4>
    When you bring your BMW to one of our Service Centres,
     it’ll go through an electronic visual health check (EVHC).
      Our trained technicians will complete a thorough inspection
      to make sure key components are running as they should be.
       Once they’ve completed the health check, they’ll provide 
       an overview and should anything need addressing this will 
       be highlighted by your Service Advisor. Which means less 
       time off the road, and more time enjoying your BMW.
</h4>

<h2>
    AUTOMATIC BMW TELESERVICE CALL.
</h2>

<h4>
    Servicing is a must – but with BMW Teleservices you no longer 
    have to take care of it yourself. Through on-board sensors, 
    your BMW knows when and what services it needs and sends the
     vehicle-related service data automatically to BMW. Your preferred
     BMW Centre can access and evaluate this data, and so effectively
      prepare for your car’s visit to the workshop - before contacting
       you to make an appointment.
</h4>
<h4>
    You can also use the BMW Teleservice Call to arrange an 
    appointment manually – simply via the press of a button.
     In any case, your BMW Service partner is already informed
     about the condition of the vehicle and is therefore in a better 
     position to respond to your requirements. Having to remember when
      your BMW service is due becomes a thing of the past.
</h4>

<h2>
    BMW SERVICE PARTNER CHANGE REQUEST.
</h2>

<h4>
    BMW Teleservices works alongside BMW ConnectedDrive,
     to provide you with effective and continuous care 
     throughout your BMW ownership. If you wish to change 
     your BMW Service Partner, you can submit a request using 
     the button below.
